=================================

Snapshot layers build on sandboxed layers but use a real FileStorage
for each layer instead of a DemoStorage.  If present on subsequent
test runs, the FileStorage corresponding to the layer is used instead
of running the layer set up again.  This can be used to greatly
expedite subsequent test runs.  It can also be used get more accurate
profiling or coverage data from the test runner by excluding the code
necessary to set up the layers.

The FileStorage files will be named after the layer name as returned
by zope.testing.testrunner.find.name_from_layer().  As such, the
effects of using snapshotted layers whose name is the same are
undefined.  The files will be placed in the directory given in the
fss_dir argument which defaults to '$INSTANCEHOME/var'.
Currently, no implementation for converting storage is provided so the
storages of any base layers must also be FileStorages.

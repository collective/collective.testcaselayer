* Prevent classes as layers

Prevent the collective.testclasslayer.layer.Layer class or subclasses
from being used as layers directly.

* Factor out collective.testclasslayer.layer

The collective.testclasslayer.layer module doesn't actually have
anything to do with test cases, but I didn't want to create a separate
package just for this one bit.  If someone wants to put this in
zope.testing or some other common testing dependency, that would be
great.
